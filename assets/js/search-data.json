            "content": "Why using Deep Learning . Artificial Intelligence becomes very popular these day and Deep Learning is one powerful technique which is used a lot ( and might dominate all others techniques in the near future ) . It is a subset of Neural Networks ( a computing systems which is insprired by biological neural networks ). And by stacking a lot of Neural Networks layers, we will get a Deep Learning model which might contains multiple billions parameters and is capable of handle very complicated problems that no classical algorithm can be effective. . . Deep learning model (src: databricks.com) | . Deep Learning is especially powerful with unstructrured data (Image, Text, Sound, Video, …). For example with around 10 lines of code and you will get a model with 99.5% accuracy in Cat/Dog classification, ex: Cats vs Dogs - fastai tutorial) . In this blog post, I will talk about my first approach to deal with Healthy/Unhealthy lung sound classification. In brief, I will firstly, convert audio signal to image, then using an existing image-classification and fine-tuning with this set of audio-images . Lung sound Introduction . Using stethoscope is the very first technique a doctor use to diagnose patient’s lung health. . Below is some samples about healthy/unhealthy lung sounds: . . Healthy Lung Sound . Unhealthy Lung Sound . From my limited knowledge, normal lung sound is kind of smoothly, low-pitched sound, in contrast with unhealthy lung sound, which is wheezing or high-pitched sound. . Because of the reputation of effectiveness using Deep Learning for Classifying Image. My first approach for this project is converting the audio file to image then using some well-known model and fine-tuning with the new data. . Representation of Sound and Spectrogram . Sound is the pressure of air propagates to our ear. Digital audio file is gotten from a sound sensor that can detects sound waves and converting it to electrical signals. . . Raw sound signal (src: Wikipedia) | . However, it is not very intuitive for us to feel this kind of representation. For us, as human, we sense a sound not only on a particular time by its intensity, but also by its pitch. The pitch is the frequency of the sound - higher pitch corresponding to higher frequency and vice versa. So, to have a representation which is closer to our brain, we can add another dimension - the frequency - to our representation, which is the Spectrogram. . . Spectrogram (src: Wikipedia) | . From the picture above, we have an image that represents a sound. X-axis is for time, y-axis is for frequency and the color is for intensity . We can use this image as input to a well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Resnet model - to classify the health’s state or lung. . Result . The dataset you can find on Kaggle Respiratory-sound-database, which has 920 sound files. . To obtain a model, you can take a look at my code on Kaggle starter kernel Lung Sound Classification. In it, I describe everthing from preprocessing the dataset, dealing with unbalance dataset and how to train model using fast.ai library. . .   . Result of training | . The result of fine-tuning model, you can find in the image above. After about 90 seconds, we get a model with 3.6% error rate on validation set. . Because the dataset is still small with only 126 patients. I think this result can not guarantee working yet. But after the Covid-19 pandemic, I believe this idea can somehow helping people. I will try to elaborate the idea, so stay tune. .",
